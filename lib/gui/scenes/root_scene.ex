#     # the Root scene pulls from the radix store on bootup, and then subscribes to changes
#     # the reason why I'm doing it this way, and not passing in the radix state
#     # from the top (which would be possible, because I initialize the
#     # radixstate during app bootup & pass it in to radix store, just so that
#     # this process can then go fetch it) is because it seems cleaner to me
#     # because if this process restarts then it will go & fetch the correct state &
#     # continue from there, vs if I pass it in then it will restart again with
#     # whatever I gave it originally (right??!?)

#     # now that I type this out... wouldn't that be a safer, better option?
#     # this process isn't supposed to crash, if it does crash probably it is due
#     # to bad state, and then probably I don't want to immediately go & fetch that
#     # bad state...

#     # for that reason I actually _am_ going to pass it in from the top

#     # After all this debate I changed my mind again, I dont want to be passing
#     # around big blobs of state, I want the RadixStore process to just keep
#     # the State and everything interacts with RadixState via that process, so
#     # this process does go & fetch RadixState on bootup

#     # Lol further addendum, I've decided that the reasoning of not wanting
#     # to pass the RadixState in because I didnt want to copy a huge state variable
#     # around is absurd given how muich I copy it around all over the place in
#     # the rest of the app, but I'm going to stick with just fetching it on
#     # startup because if the whole GUI does crash up to this level, I want
#     # it to start again from the current RadixStore
